title:  "Common Numbers You Should Know"
---

This post is inspired by Jeff Dean's list of "Numbers Everyone Should Know". 
I wanted to 1) update Jeff's numbers to reflect the latest generation of technologies
2) add more relevant numbers that are not covered in the original list. 

|Op |Number| Notes   |
|---|---|---|
|L1 cache   | 0.5-1ns, 1TB/s, 32KB  |  L1 access takes ~4 CPU cycles. For a 4GHz CPU, this is ~1ns. [1] |
|L2 | 5ns, 1TB/s, 256KB  | ~10 cycles. Note that L2 may be shared by multiple cores. [1] |
|L3 | 50ns, 500GB/s, >8MB  |   |
|Main memory (DDR3) | 100ns, 10GB/s, ~1GHz  | [2] Not sure how up to date the 100ns latency is. |
|Main memory (DDR4) | ?ns, 30GB/s, ~3GHz  | [3]  Not sure how up to date the 100ns latency is.|
|Main memory (HBM) | ?ns, 200GB/s  | Need to verify |
|SSD | 20us, 10GB/s  | [4] but sources such as [6] suggest SSD bw can be lower than 1GB/s |
|NVM| 300ns, 5GB/s |  [5] |
|Hard disk drive | 10ms, 100MB/s  | [6]  |


## Availability Levels [7]

|Nines | Downtime per year | per day |
|---|---|---|
|90% | 37 days | 2.4hr |
|95% | 18 days| 1.2hr |
|99% | 5 days| 14min |
|99.9% | 9 hr| 1.4min |
|99.99% | 53 min| 8.6s |
|99.999% | 5 min| 0.9s |

<span style="color:red"> what is required in practice to get 5 nines? If I need to design such a system, what optimizations would I need to do?</span>.

<span style="color:red"> How can Raft afford to use a single master to serve all client requests? Does this not create a performance bottleneck? </span>.
